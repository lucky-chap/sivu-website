Thanks for showing interest to contribute to Sivu 💖, you're awesome!

When it comes to contributing, there are different ways you can contribute, all
of which are greatly appreciated. Here are some guidelines to help. You can use the TOC (Table Of Contents) to help you navigate around.

## Get started

To get stared follow these easy step by step instructions:

1. Fork the repo (click the <kbd>Fork</kbd> button at the top right of
   [this page](https://github.com/Sivu-Tutorials/website))

2. Clone your fork locally, and open it.

3. Use the following commands to run the website locally (use this if you want a preview of the site)

```sh
yarn
```
This command downloads and initiates all the dependancies needed to make your website run


```sh
yarn dev
```
This command starts the development server at `localhost:3000` usually. 
If you're running Windows, contentlayer might not work as expected, so you'd need to do `npx contentlayer build` before running `yarn dev` in order to generate the docsite content.

> If you run into any issues, kindly reach out to the team by opening an issue here
> https://github.com/Sivu-Tutorials/website/issues/new

### Commands

**`yarn`**: installs the dependency packages.

**`yarn dev`**: starts the local development server.

**`yarn build`**: builds the docsite for production.

**`yarn clean`**: deletes the `yarn.lock` file and `node_modules`

### Steps to PR
`PR` = Pull Request

2. Create a new branch out of the `main` branch in your fork. You can call this whatever you like.

3. Make and commit your changes to that branch. Next, you're ready to submit a PR!
