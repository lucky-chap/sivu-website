## Introduction

Docusaurus is used to generate static files. Docusaurus is a documentation tool
used by many companies in documenting their processes. It was developed by
Facebook. It is easy to use and it is easy to customize according to your needs.
It is a great tool to help you to document your projects.

## Requirements

- NodeJS `-` Tutorial on how to install [NodeJS](/guides/nodejs)
- Visual Studio Code (or alternative IDE) `-` For VS Code,
  [install here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

### Getting started locally

We need to install Docusaurus locally, that is, on our machines. To do this,

1. Open a new terminal in your Visual Studio Code window.
   - You can do this by selecting the "terminal" tab from the top bar

2. In the terminal type `npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic`
3. You will receive a prompt asking you if you want to proceed with the
   installation.
   - Type `y` to proceed
4. You'll see a new folder appear! Navigate into the folder by doing the
   command: `cd my-website`
5. Now, install everything needed to make the site work. You can do this by
   typing `npm install` into the terminal
6. You're now ready to start the site locally! use the command `npm run start`
   you'll see some messages come up to let you know its working.
7. Finally, open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser and follow the tutorial
   on screen made by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)

Your Docusaurus site is now running locally, and it's ready to be published on
the web!

## Preperation

Most online hosting providers require you to upload your website to a code
store. A good one is [GitHub](https://github.com).

GitHub is a code hosting service that allows you to store your code on a server.
It is free and allows you to host your code on the web. GitHub Desktop is a free
desktop application that allows you to manage your code on GitHub.

We are going to use GitHub to host our site and GitHub Desktop to manage our
code.

### Steps you can follow

1. Sign up for an account at [GitHub](https://github.com)
2. On your machine, install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) Follow
   the on-screen instructions to setup.
3. When installed, open Github desktop. Select File, New Repository
4. Give it a name and description, then select create.
5. In the Local Path, it'll say the location of the new repo you've made.
   Navigate to that folder in a seperate file manager.
6. Upload your website files (files inside the "my-website" folder) into that
   folder
7. Open github desktop and commit the changes, then click publish.
8. Congrats! That's all for the preperation.
