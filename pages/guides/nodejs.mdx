How to install NodeJS(NPM) on your device.

NodeJS is needed for most static site generators like React, NextJS, etc...

### Steps

1. Navigate to the [NodeJS Website](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Select the download button that reads "Recommended For Most Users".
3. A file will be downloaded onto your device. When it's downloaded, open the
   file.
4. Select "Next", accept the terms and conditions, then select "Next" again.
5. You'll be asked where you want to install NodeJS to. Leave this as default
   for simplicity, then click "Next".
6. You'll be shown a features popup. Leave this as deafult and select "Next".
7. On the final page, **ensure that the checkbox is checked**. Ensure the
   checkbox that reads: "Automatically install the necessary..." is checked.
8. Select "Next", then "Install".
9. Once the installation is complete in the application, click "Finish".
10. A PowerShell window will open. Follow any on-screen instructions and allow
    the installation process to continue (It may take a while, depending on your
    machine).
11. Restart your computer and congrats! It's installed.
